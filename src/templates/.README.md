The GitHub Packages API doesn't expose much of the publicly-available metadata that other registries provide. This completely automated closed-loop system [is the solution](https://github.com/badges/shields/issues/5594#issuecomment-2157626147).

**Just star this project to have GitHub serve JSON and XML endpoints for your public packages and those of any organizations you're publicly a part of!** A service ran by GitHub will add them to its circular priority queue within the next few hours and update the [dataset](https://github.com/<GITHUB_OWNER>/<GITHUB_REPO>/releases/latest). If you'd then like the service to forget and ignore some or all of your packages, add `owner[/repo[/package]]` to `optout.txt` [here](https://github.com/<GITHUB_OWNER>/<GITHUB_REPO>/edit/<GITHUB_BRANCH>/optout.txt) and make a pull request.

To add any other users or organizations not yet [in the index](https://github.com/<GITHUB_OWNER>/<GITHUB_REPO>/tree/index), add the case-sensitive name of each one on a new line in `owners.txt` on your own fork [here](https://github.com/ipitio/backage/edit/master/owners.txt) and make a pull request. Please add just the name(s) -- ids, repos, and packages will be obtained automatically!

Use something like [shields.io/json](https://shields.io/badges/dynamic-json-badge) or [shields.io/xml](https://shields.io/badges/dynamic-xml-badge) with the endpoint parameters below to access the latest data and make badges like these:

## Endpoint

```py
https://<GITHUB_OWNER>.github.io/<GITHUB_REPO>/OWNER/REPO/PACKAGE.FORMAT
```

Replace `OWNER/REPO/PACKAGE.FORMAT` with their respective values. The format can be either `json` or `xml`. If you're using Shields.io to evaluate expressions, like filters, you'll need the XML endpoint; see [this issue](https://github.com/ipitio/backage/issues/23).

## Path

<details>

<summary>JSON</summary>

You can query a package for its properties, like size or version:

```js
$.PROPERTY
```

```js
$.size
```

Versions may be filtered in and tags out:

```js
$.version[FILTER].PROPERTY
```

```js
$.version[?(@.latest)].tags[?(@!="latest")]
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>XML</summary>

You can query a package for its properties, like size or version:

```py
/bkg/PROPERTY
```

```py
/bkg/size
```

Versions can be filtered in and tags out:

```py
/bkg/version[FILTER]/PROPERTY
```

```py
/bkg/version[./latest[.="true"]]/tags[.!="latest"]
```
